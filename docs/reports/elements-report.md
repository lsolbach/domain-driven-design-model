 :ddd/c-anti-corruption-layer | Anti-Corruption Layer | :concept |  | The anti-corruption layer is an architectural layer to separate the domain model from outside models. It enables the domain model to access the data of the outside model as expected by the domain model. In a clean architecture, an adapter is the place to implement the anti- corruption layer by mapping the outside model to the domain model. |  | #{"Pattern"}
 :ddd/c-entities | Entities | :concept |  | Objects in the domain model which are defined by their identity rather than by their state. For example a Person is normally modelled as an entity. It represents the same person even when the attributes change. It is also a different person, even if it has the same state as another person. |  | #{"Pattern"}

 :ddd/c-value-objects | Value Objects | :concept |  | An object in the domain model, which has no conceptional identity but are identified by their state. Value objects should be modelled as immutable. |  | #{"Pattern"}

 :ddd/c-aggregates | Aggregates | :concept |  | Aggregates are collections of entities and value objects with their associations and form a transactional unit. Aggregates are referenced as a whole by an aggregate root entity, parts of the aggregate must not be referenced from outside. The aggregate root is responsible for the enforcement of the busines rules and invariants of the aggregate. |  | #{"Pattern"}
 :ddd/c-large-scale-structure | Large Scale Structure | :concept |  |  |  | #{"Pattern"}

 :ddd/c-domain-events | Domain Events | :concept |  | A domain object to propagate relevant domain activities in a distributed system. |  | #{"Pattern"}
