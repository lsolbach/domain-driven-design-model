#Core Domain (Concept)
## Description
The most valuable part of the domain model.
## Documentation
In a large system, there are so many contributing components, all complicated
and all absolutely necessary to success, that the essence of the domain model,
the real business asset, can be obscured and neglected.

It is harsh reality that not all parts of the design are going to be equally
refined. Priorities must be set. To make the domain model an asset, the
critical core of that model has to be sleek and fully leveraged to create
application functionality. But scarce, highly skilled developers tend to
gravitate to technical infrastructure or neatly definable domain problems that
can be understood without specialized domain knowledge.

Therefore,

Boil the model down. Define a core domain and provide a means of easily
distinguishing it from the mass of supporting model and code. Bring the most
valuable and specialized concepts into sharp relief. Make the core small.

Apply top talent to the core domain, and recruit accordingly. Spend the effort
in the core to find a deep model and develop a supple design â€” sufficient to
fulfill the vision of the system.

Justify investment in any other part by how it supports the distilled core.
